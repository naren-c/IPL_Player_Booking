# IPL_Player_Booking
Software application that can be used to simulate bidding/ player booking for IPL teams. 

Description in points: This project will demonstrate the following
• Display all player details in the auction pool (player name, role playing, batting, bowling, nationality)
• Display team details (players in each team with player details, budget left for bidding)
• Option for teams to bid for players from the base price of each player
• Once bidding starts for a player, the team should quote its price within a given time limit and this will 
set the base price for the player for the next bid. The highest bidder will recruit the player
